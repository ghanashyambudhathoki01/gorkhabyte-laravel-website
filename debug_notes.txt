Route [dashboard] is checking roles but user is being redirected.

Based on the users_dump.json file I created earlier:
- Admin user: ID 10, email: ghanashyambudhathoki0@gmail.com, role: "admin"
- Student users: IDs 6-9, all with role: "student"

Current route logic in web.php (lines 22-40):
1. Check if isAdmin() → show admin dashboard
2. Check if isStudent() → redirect to student.dashboard
3. Otherwise → redirect to home

The user is being redirected to student portal, which means:
- Either they're logged in as a student account (IDs 6-9)
- Or isAdmin() is failing despite having role 'admin'

Need to:
1. Verify which account the user is currently logged in as
2. If logged in as student, ask them to log out and log in with admin account
3. If logged in as admin but isAdmin() failing, investigate why
